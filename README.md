# TwoEmailsSpecFlowTest
When performing a task, you must use the capabilities of Selenium WebDriver, a unit test framework (for example, NUnit) and the concept of Page Object.
Create two fake accounts on different email services.
Implement the following autotests:

1. Login tests 
  - the ability to login with the correct login/password pair
  - unable to login with wrong password and/or login
  - unable to login with empty login/password
  
2. Log in to one of the services and send a letter from it to another mailbox of a predetermined arbitrary content. Make sure that the letter has reached and is displayed as unread and that it has the correct sender.
